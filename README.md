# push_swap
my 6th project in 42, the README says everything
|
|
Let me be fucking clear, this fucking README will feel like a fucking limp bizkit song for the ammount of fucks and fucking i will use
|
So Let's start this shitty readme, in case you didn't understand, i fucking despise this project
|
So_long took longer and this was more fucking satisfying to finish due to being set free i literally feel like a bird
|
So you basically have to sort an array of numbers in a stack as if a Bubble sort couldn't do it in 5 microseconds
|
As if it wasn't enough you have another stack that you NEED to use to reorder the beginning stack (so 2 fuckers, a(starting stack) and b) and you MUST do it trough a series of operations
- swap (First Two Elements of the stack get swapped yeah you get the fucking idea)
- rotate (all fucking elements shift to 1 space to the left, the last one becomes the first one)
- rev_rotate (same fucking thing but to the right)
- push (to send numbers to a stack to the other)

If you hate this project like i do i suggest you use radix, quick easy (still tedious as fuck) and you learn a bit of shit about bit shifting in case you wanna do minitalk
|
Gotta say you learn how a stack and linked list work...the algorithm part? That's not the git for you if you look for it, the mechanical turk was way too long to code for me...
|
Some stuff is coded following norme and trying to save my ass from memory leaks, I had to make 2 fucking atols to prevent em (i might be an idiot).

Possible questions:

Why a Small_sort
|
-The radix makes a lot of moves, enough to get an 84, but one of the checkmarks on the correction sheet says that for stacks with a size <= 5 has to make 12 moves or less, so you have to do it.

Why the radix
|
- I did the radix cuz i was lazy, and i am too lazy to write another detailed answer

I am fucking done.
Have fun with every moment where you don't think of this project.
